# BF/BI510: Institutional Racism in Health and Science


Historically, scientific theories and methodologies have been inappropriately,
and sometimes fraudulently, employed to provide justification for establishing
and maintaining social, economic, and racial hierarchies, resulting in
centuries of dehumanizing and unethical practices toward certain groups,
especially against Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC).
Unfortunately, many of these pernicious ideas persist, such that they hinder
opportunities of BIPOC in Science and exacerbate their health outcomes. 

This course traces the historical roots of racism in science through to its
modern manifestations, examines the harmful consequences on victims' health
outcomes, and presents ideas, approaches, and practices to ameliorate and
eradicate the presence of racism in our institutions.

## Course Objectives <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a>

The pedagogical goal of this course is to develop student competencies in
discriminating between fact-based conclusions and unsupported pseudoscience and
constructing empirical knowledge for themselves.  We will focus on the
empirical process behind interrogating and dismantling disinformation and
pseudoscience in the specific context of racism.  Students will learn the
skills needed at each step of inquiry and walk through a stepwise process:

1. learning about the biological background on scientific topics
2. learning to critically analyze data and critique conclusions in primary sources
3. learning to engage with one another and talk to others about their critical analyses
4. learning to apply this critical reasoning to other topics outside of race.

Beyond racism, scientific reasoning has been and still is used to form the
basis for discrimination against many different groups.  Beyond the context of
this course, students will gain the skills needed to apply this same process to
look at issues of ableism, sexism, and gender discrimination.  BF/BI510 will
prepare students to look at the scientific and popular literature and dismantle
systemic inequity from its foundations.

## The Instrument <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a>

![The Instrument](assets/images/the_instrument.png)

“The Instrument” is a tool we are developing in this class to help identify
hidden biases in a text. It is a structured approach to reading a text that has
the following phases:

1. **Annotate** -  label key words, phrases, or sentences with a controlled set
   of hashtags

2. **Analyze** - answer a set of short answer questions designed to identify key
   aspects of the text

3. **Synthesize** - write a short narrative reflection about the article guided
   by a set of scaffolding questions

We will apply The Instrument to readings throughout the course. A more detailed
description of The Instrument is found [here](the_instrument.html).

<a id="grading">
## Grading <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a>

**Weekly annotations (50% of grade):** Students will submit applications of the
instrument on weekly readings that will be used to assess participation and
engagement.

**Three case study reflections (20% of grade):** There are three case studies
assigned to readings throughout the semester.

**Peer review activities (10% of grade):** Students will review their peers’
submissions for parts of the final project and learn how to provide
constructive feedback on a written abstracts. 

**Final Project (20% of grade):**  Each student will complete a final project
and report (~5 pages) about an aspect of systemic racism in health and science
of their own choosing.  The Final Project Assignment will be posted on the
course website in the first weeks of class, and class time will be dedicated mid-semester to discussing
project ideas and expectations.  The assignment will involve
creating a short presentation (possible formats include a podcast, narrated
poster, or YouTube video) and submission of a written report detailing the
motivation and logic and research behind your project of choice.  Presentations
will be shared with the class (exact details will depend on formats preferred
by students), and a written report will be due by final exam time.  Reports
will be submitted via the Perusall site.

### Office Hours

Scheduled for 2 hours weekly, based on best cohort
availability. In person meetings with the instructor are always available upon
request.

### Office of Disability and Access Services

The Office of Disability and
Access Services (25 Buick Street, Suite 300) is responsible for assisting
students with disabilities. If you have a disability, you are strongly
encouraged to register with this office. Lecture hall and discussion rooms are
accessible and ADA compliant.

### Learning and Testing Accommodation
Boston University complies with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. If
you are a student who needs academic accommodations because of a documented
disability, you must present your letter of accommodation from the Office of
Disability and Access Services directly to the instructor as soon as possible.
If you have questions about documenting a disability or requesting academic
accommodations, contact the Office of Disability and Access Services. Letters
of accommodations should be presented as soon as possible to ensure that
student needs are addressed from the start of the course. Instructors are not
able to provide accommodations without documentation from Boston University's
Office of Disability and Access Services.

### Support from the Instructor

Finally, if you tell me that you are having
trouble, I will not judge you or think less of you. You do not owe me an
explanation of your health (physical or mental) or the health of your loved
ones; but you are welcome to tell me and I will listen. Even if I can’t help
you directly, it is likely that I know someone who can. If you need help or
more information, please ask, and I will work with you.

<a id="policies">
## Community of Learning: Class and University Policies <a class="tiny-link" href="#">Top</a>

### Diversity, Inclusion, Anti-racism

This course is a judgement free and
anti-racist learning environment. Our cohort consists of students from a wide
variety of social identities and life circumstances. Everyone will treat one
another with respect and consideration at all times or be asked to leave the
classroom (physical or virtual).

The instructors of this course pledge to:

1. Learn and correctly pronounce everyone’s preferred name/nickname

2. Use preferred pronouns for those who wish to indicate this to me/the class

3. Work to accommodate/prevent language related challenges (for instance I will avoid the use of idioms and slang)

### Attendance

Attendance is not used as a criterion for assessment in this course. This a primarily in-person course and lectures and discussion are held at Photonics Room 202.  
Zoom links and recordings will be made available during/after each session to accomodate remote MS learners (Biology/Bioinfo).

### Policy on Religious Observances

Due dates can be revised for documented
religious observances according to the specifications of the University Policy
on Religious Observance
(http://www.bu.edu/ctl/university-policies/policy-on-religious-observance/).
Please make sure to communicate about religious observances as far in advance
as possible (and no later than one week before the observance, per university
policy) so that accommodations can be made.

### Assignment Completion & Late Work

Assignment can be submitted on their
scheduled due dates by 11.59.59 EST via Perusalldropboxes or alternately they
may be emailed to melosbor@bu.edu. Assessment and feedback will be provided
via Perusall grading function. A late penalty of -10% per day will be
assessed, though deadline extensions are available on a case by case basis (the
earlier the instructor is informed of conflicts/extension needs, the better).

### Illness and Assignment Deadlines

We hope that all of you will remain
healthy throughout the semester and are able to fully engage and participate in
the course. If you do unfortunately become ill, we require that you follow the
protocols mandated by the University under those circumstances. The course
attendance and engagement policies already reflect substantial flexibility to
allow for absences of short to moderate length due to illness. Please make
sure to contact your instructor about any absences that will last beyond a
couple of days. In the case of a prolonged illness that is not already covered
by the course absence policies, we will work with the CAS Dean's office to
determine the best course of action for any given student.

### Academic Conduct

The community at Boston University has adopted the
following Academic Conduct Code: “All students entering Boston University are
expected to maintain high standards of academic honesty and integrity.”
Obviously, the full text is more detailed. The expectation is that you will
adhere to this code, as your instructor pledges to do as well. For more
information, please visit this website:
http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/. In keeping with
this code, cheating, plagiarism, or any other form of academic dishonesty will
not be tolerated (ACC III) and will be referred to the Dean’s Office.

### Proper use of Online Resources

Students at Boston University are required to abide by all regulations
regarding academic integrity and conduct, including the proper use of
technology and digital resources. Course materials are provided by faculty for
your personal use in the course only. Any other use of these materials
including, but not limited to, posting of materials online in forums or
websites, is a copyright violation and a violation of the academic
conduct code. Additionally, materials submitted for course credit (papers,
exams, etc.) are similarly not permitted to be used or posted.

### COVID-19 Responsibilities and Regulations

We are all in this together, and we are committed to offering the best learning
experience possible given the need for safety. To do this, we need your help.
We must all be responsible and respectful. Faculty, staff, and teaching fellows
will wear masks during class and other meetings to protect you; and we expect
you to do the same. If you show up without a mask, you will be asked to leave.
If you refuse, the class or meeting will be dismissed in order to protect
everyone. We also require that you follow the safety practices recommended by
the CDC outside the classroom, including all state and university guidelines
regarding sheltering in place while feeling ill, testing, quarantining, social
contacts, and gatherings. If you cannot follow these guidelines, be responsible
and respectful: do not show up for in-person learning. Do not put your
classmates, staff and instructors in danger. Do your learning remotely to make
it possible for us to safely offer in-person learning to others.
